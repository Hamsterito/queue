Instructions for creating a bot token (BotFather)

Users who start running channels in messenger often don't know where to get a bot token in Telegram. The thing is that the messenger itself has the “father” of all bots - it is a channel called @botfather. It is there that you will be able to find your bot token. 

The following instruction will show you how to get a Telegram bot token:

-Open the messenger on your PC or phone.

-Type the word “@botfather” in the search box.

-Type the word “@botfather” in the search box

-Go to the dialog and click on the “Start” button.

-Go to the dialog and click the “Start” button.

-The program will give you a list of commands that you can use to control BotFather.

-Choose the command called “/new_bot”. This is the one that will give you the ability to create a token for your bot in Telegram.

-Select the command that is called “/new_bot”

-Next, the system will ask you to spell out the name of your bot. Give it a name, type it in the reply line and send it to BotFather.

-Next, the system will ask for the name of your bot. Give it a name.

-After this procedure, the system will ask for the nickname of the future bot, it must contain the prefix “_bot”.

-If the nickname will coincide with those names that are already in the system, it will reject it. Therefore, think up an original nickname, type it in and wait until the system accepts your variant.
